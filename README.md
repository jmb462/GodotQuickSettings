# GodotQuickSettings for Godot 3.4
Quick settings plugin for Godot.
Easily access and edit your favorite project settings directly from an editor dock without having to browse hundreds of properties in Project Settings window.

A property selector popups.
Select the property in the tree. You can filter properties by keywords.
After validating your choice with the "OK" button or by double-clicking on a property, this property will be shown in the QuickSettings dock.
You can now edit this setting directly from QuickSettings.
